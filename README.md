The majority of current pavement condition assessment techniques are labor-intensive and
manual. Existing techniques for identifying and evaluating potholes rely on 3D surface
reconstruction, which is expensive in terms of both hardware and compute, or on acceleration
data, which only yields preliminary results. We are looking for teams to propose a low-cost
method for automatically identifying potholes and judging their severity using vision-based data
for both 2D and 3D reconstruction.


Utilizing the visual and spatial qualities of potholes as well as the measurement parameters
(width, quantity, and depth) that are used to estimate pothole severity, we would like to
understand how both 2D and 3D reconstruction can be combined to improve recognition results.
While the width and depth of the potholes are determined using 3D reconstruction, the number
and location of potholes is determined using 2D recognition.


Data gathering, distress identification and classification, and distress evaluation are the three
steps in the pavement assessment process. Modern data collection techniques are being quickly
replaced by inspection vehicles. These inspection vehicles can gather data at speeds of up to 60
mph (96 km/h), thanks to their numerous sensors, which include cameras for surface imaging,
optical sensors for distance measurement, laser scanners for profiling, ultrasonic sensors for
rutting detection, and accelerometers for roughness measurements. The second and third
processes of distress classification and assessment are still mostly manual despite the
automation of the data collection procedure. Currently, technicians manually examine the
collected data to determine the existence of distresses and gauge their severity from the
computer screen. Such a labor-intensive manual method might become unsystematic due to the
volume of data that needs to be collected, which eventually lowers the assessment's quality.
Although there are clear rules for manual diagnosis and assessment of asphalt distress, the
technicians' experience affects the assessment's outcome. A hybrid imaging device that
combines digital cameras and infrared lasers to capture continuous images of lines projected by
infrared lasers is based on 3D surface profiles from time-of-flight laser scanners to classify and
quantify pavement deterioration. These commercial software programs do not, however, count
or identify all the potholes that have been spotted.
